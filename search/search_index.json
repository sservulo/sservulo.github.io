Working with robotics for the past few years, I\u2019ve been involved with varying degrees of product development in the industry, be it prototyping a novel robot at Aeolus, polishing a market product and expanding business at Balyo or developing core open source tools for the ROS robotics community. In my current position with Balyo I successfully led the company\u2019s first Latin America projects, working closely with clients, defining requirements, architecture and implementing software and APIs across multiple projects used daily in a multi billion dollar industry. While at Aeolus I was heavily involved in the architecture, development and test of the autonomous navigation stack (accurate SLAM / localization, maps, sensor drivers and external API) of a domestic robot prototype displayed at CES 2018. Before that, while working at Cinnecta, I collaborated on a major backend refactor to handle millions of daily users and provide insightful analytic data to one of Brazilian biggest mobile carriers by means of scalable architecture and concise API, bringing Cinnecta to the big data and machine learning era. I love C++ and Python, systems (and robots!) that perform beautifully and have a soft spot for cool technology and interesting problems in multiple areas. Nowadays I've been investing most of my free time working on small home automation projects, learning to bake and exploring trails with my dog. If anything, I'm a versatile and easy-going person that likes to solve problems, read books and tell a good story.","title":"About"},{"location":"resume/","text":"Collaborations Lead Application Engineer | Balyo (Brazil) | Dec. 2018 \u2013 Present Successfully led company\u2019s first Latin America projects working alongside clients. Optimized and fine-tuned software for a fleet of several industrial Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGV) and Supervisor, moving more than 3k pallets of inventory daily, 24x7. Defined requirements, architecture and implemented software used across multiple projects. Led major improvement efforts on software architecture and tooling (modularization, code reuse and versioning). Led effort to bring LSP features to internal Domain Specific Language (DSL). Robotics Software Engineer | Ekumen (Remote) | Oct. 2018 \u2013 Dec. 2018 Collaborated with Open Robotics on the design, implementation and testing of actionlib native ROS2 package for preemptive action scheduling and C++/Python action type support for Crystal Clemmys release. Robotics Software Engineer | Aeolus Robotics (Remote) | June 2017 \u2013 Aug. 2018 Collaborated on the design and implementation of core autonomous navigation components of a domestic robot displayed in CES 2018, such as map pipeline, SLAM / localization and sensor drivers using C++, ROS, Eigen, OpenCV. Optimized localization pipeline for autonomous navigation (30% more accurate on avg). Performed real world integration and optimization of internal navigation modules in a resource constrained robot. Integration and tuning of critical SLAM modules such as Cartographer and MRPT for the navigation stack. Software Engineer | Cinnecta (Brazil) | Oct. 2016 \u2013 June 2017 Refactored user experience analytic software to scale 10x using Java, Python, Spark and Cassandra. Created core Business Intelligence reports for user experience analysis using Java, Ruby on Rails, MySQL. Software Engineer | Netbee (Brazil) | Aug. 2014 \u2013 Feb. 2016 Created a common REST backend service used by all internal projects using Java and Spring. Collaborated on the design and development of end-to-end solution (cloud and mobile) to search and track stolen vehicles using Internet of Things and social collaboration. Research Assistant | Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Brazil) | March 2012 \u2013 April 2015 Created a sensor fusion approach for object recognition using audiovisual features acquired from sensors on a robot using Python, C++, OpenCV, PCL and ROS. This approach improved object recognition rate in 8% in normal conditions and up to 5x in high interference scenarios (visual and/or auditory). Developed a lightweight SLAM algorithm to execute on real environment relying solely on odometry and laser range finder information for fast processing using C++, ROS. Software Engineer | Tivit Synapsis | Sept. 2011 \u2013 Jan. 2012 Refactored components of legacy business software to up to date technologies using .NET platform. Designed and developed a field team scheduler using C#, given time and resource constraints.
